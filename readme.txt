Yousif Dafalla EECS-776 Final Project

Summary:

This is an application to perform symmetric encryption and hashing using Haskell. I utilized the cryptonite Haskell package. I worked on this project by myself.

For the Hashing I implemented the following four algorithms:
SHA256, SHA1, MD5 and MD4.

For the symmetric encryption I implemented the following four algorithms: AES256, Blowfish256, DES and CAST5.




Running the program:

To be able to run the application you need to install the following:

1. cryptonite

To install cryptonite type the following command:

* stack install cryptonite

2. Ansi terminal

To install the ansi terminal type the following command:
	
* stack install ansi-terminal


To get an executable type the following command:

* stack ghc encrypt_hash.hs

To execute the program type the following:

* ./encrypt_hash
